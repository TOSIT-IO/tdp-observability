# TDP Grafana Dashboards

Grafana dashboards to monitor a TDP cluster.

## Dashboards

- Cluster nodes metrics: [Node Exporter Full (v27)](./node-exporter-full.v27.json) from [rfmoz/grafana-dashboards](https://github.com/rfmoz/grafana-dashboards)
- TDP cluster metrics: [TDP Cluster Overview (v1)](./tdp-cluster.v1.json)
- ZooKeeper metrics: [TDP ZooKeeper (v1)](./tdp-zookeeper.v1.json) inspired from [10465-zookeeper-by-prometheus](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10465-zookeeper-by-prometheus/) (the dashboard looks quite different as a lot of metrics were introduced in ZooKeeper 3.6)
- HDFS metrics: [TDP HDFS (v1)](./tdp-hdfs.v1.json)
- YARN metrics: [TDP YARN (v1)](./tdp-yarn.v1.json)
- HBase metrics: [TDP HBase (v1)](./tdp-hbase.v1.json)
- Hive metrics: [TDP Hive (v1)](./tdp-hive.v1.json)
